# G-Arts
G'Arts is an open-source web-application focused on improving cybersecurity literacy through interactive engagement. It helps in integrating information security (InfoSec) fundamentals into a modular application featuring reactive quiz components and challenge-based micro-games.<hr>

<h3><b>Core Feature of G'Arts:</b></h3>

<b>1. Reactive Quiz Components:</b> These aren't your standard multiple-choice tests. They provide immediate feedback, adapting to the user's input to reinforce learning through "active recall" and instant correction.

<b>2. Challenge-Based Micro-Games:</b> Instead of just reading about a "Brute Force" attack, users might play a 30-second game that simulates one. This hands-on engagement helps bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

<b>3. Open-Source Literacy:</b> Because it's open-source, the community can audit the code and contribute new challenges, ensuring the literacy material stays up-to-date with the ever-evolving threat landscape.
